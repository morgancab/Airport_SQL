    "In this notebook, we'll explore various aspects of airline operations using SQL queries. Our dataset comprises three tables: `airlines`, `airports`, and `flights`. By leveraging SQL queries, we aim to extract valuable insights to understand airline performance, identify trends, and address operational challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions Addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distinct Airlines:**\n",
    "   - Understanding the variety of airlines operating in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maximum Distance Analysis by Airline:**\n",
    "   - Determining which airlines operate flights covering the longest distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Busiest Departure Days from Top 10 Airports:**\n",
    "   - Identifying the busiest days for departures from the top 10 airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cancellation Ratio Analysis by Airline:**\n",
    "   - Assessing the cancellation ratios of different airlines to gauge their reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Top 10 Airports with the Highest Average Arrival Delays in January:**\n",
    "   - Identifying airports with significant average arrival delays in a specific month.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Analysis of On-time Landings Despite Departure Delays Exceeding 15 Minutes by Airlines:**\n",
    "   - Evaluating which airlines maintain on-time arrivals despite departure delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Airlines Table:**\n",
    "  - Contains information about various airlines, including their names and unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Airports Table:**\n",
    "  - Provides details about airports, such as their names, locations, and unique codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flights Table:**\n",
    "  - Includes comprehensive flight data, such as departure/arrival times, distances, cancellations, delays, and associated airline and airport codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll utilize SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset.\n",
    "- Each query will be accompanied by a brief explanation of its purpose and the insights it provides.\n",
    "- Visualizations may complement some analyses for clearer interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's Dive In!\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, let's delve into our SQL queries to uncover valuable insights into airline operations and performance.\n"
